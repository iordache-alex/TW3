## Story

People Always Talk About The Weather...

They are also always checking the weather in native and web applications.

Now you can go further and create your own web based Weather application!

This application should allow you, as a user to enter a city name (and be gently helped by an autocomplete in selecting it), and see the specific weather in that city. 
It should have a pleasing UI/UX, that blends in an photo from the city with the rest of the application.
